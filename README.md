# Simple devcontainer

A simple and bare minimum devcontainer. To quickly clone and experiment with.

## IMPORTANT

If your container crashes with a unknown fault. Most likely you need to delete the container and the image, and rebuild.

I've added a script to do this for us (from Linux hosts). Check the `CLEAN.sh`-script.
